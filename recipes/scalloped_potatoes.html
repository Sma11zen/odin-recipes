    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds potatoes, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>Â½ onion, thinly sliced</li>
            
        <li>9 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, diced and divided</li>
            
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            
        <li>3 cups whole milk, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1/3 of the potato slices into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with about 1/3 of the 
            onion slices. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons flour over the potato and onion. Arrange 2 tablespoons butter atop the flour. 
            Season the entire layer with salt and pepper. Repeat layering twice more.</li>
        <li>Heat milk in a saucepan until warm. Pour enough warm milk over the mixture in the baking dish so the top of the 
            liquid is level with the final layer of potatoes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and the creamy sauce is bubbling with a golden brown crust 
            on top, 45 to 60 minutes. The cream sauce may bubble up over the sides of the baking dish; place a baking sheet 
            underneath to catch any drips. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
